# NeuralSight

NeuralSight uses deep neural networks to help detect and understand objects in pictures or videos. You can use this project to snap a photo of something or show it what your camera sees, and then NeuralSight will tell you what's in the picture and where it is.
NeuralSight is a computer program that can recognise objects such as cars, animals, and people using pre-trained models, like YOLOv3.
